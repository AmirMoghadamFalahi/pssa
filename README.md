Singular Spectrum Analysis for time series forecasting in Python

An example of the implementation of this code can be found in **[Singular Spectrum Analysis Example.ipynb](https://github.com/aj-cloete/pySSA/blob/master/Singular%20Spectrum%20Analysis%20Example.ipynb)**.

I will update the list of references/credits at another time. The research of *[Nina Golyandina](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1druVRYAAAAJ&hl=it)* from Russia was invaluable in aiding my understanding of this method.
